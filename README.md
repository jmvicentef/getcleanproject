# Final project Getting and Cleaning Data (Coursera Data Science course)
Final project for the Coursera course Getting and Cleaning Data. It uses the data from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1]. It contains the following elements:

1. An R script called 'run_analysis.R' that does the following: it merges the train and test data sets in one single data set, it extracts measurements of the mean and SD for each measurement, it assigns new labels to the activities in the data sets.
2. A clean data set resulting from this analysis.
3. A codebook under the name 'CodeBook.md' describing the variables, the data and any transformations or work performed to clean the data.
4. And this readme file.
